<h3>About Me</h3>

	<div class="intro">
&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Currently, I'm a Ph.D. Candidate at Laboratory of Unmanned Intelligent Systems, Beihang University, China. I got my B.S. from Xi'an Jiaotong University in 2019.  
&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;My research centers on the development of a centimeter-scale, motor-driven flapping-wing robot, which is truly insect-like in terms of tailless and two-winged configurations, attitude control approach, and hovering flight capability. I carried out studies to optimize its flight performance by inventing simple yet effective designs for lightweight and improving lift generation and power efficiency for long endurance flights.  
&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;My research also targets a multimodal and multifunctional bio-inspired robot that in addition to flight can be equipped with more modes of transportation such as jumping, crawling, running, etc., similar to real flying animals.
